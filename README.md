# Web based 3D design app

A project I'm currently working on.  


It will be a web-based 3d-editor, where users can upload images of clothing items from the web, or from their computer, and view what they will look like on them, before bying them.  
Users can also message, and share their designs with their friends in the application.  

I might add a NodeJs server to it to imporve performance.  
I will also build, and train my own neural network for it with TensorFlow, that can recognize which pieces of clothing user uploads to the editor.


# Demo  
To test application in its current state run the following command, and you can view it at http://localhost:3000
```diff
docker run -p 3000:3000 aleksi1212/3d-design-app-demo
