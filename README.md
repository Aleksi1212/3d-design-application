# nextJs13-app

A project I'm currently working on.  


It will be a web-based 3d-editor, where users can upload images of clothing items from the web, or from their computer, and view what they will look like on them, before bying them.  
Users can also message, and share their designs with their friends in the application.  



I might add a NodeJs server to it to imporve performance.  
I will also build, and train my own neural network for it with TensorFlow, that can recognize which pieces of clothing does the user upload.
